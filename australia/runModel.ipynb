    "+ `domain`: definition of the unstructured grid containing the vtk grid `filename` and the associated field (here called `Z`) as well as the flow direction method to be used `flowdir` that takes an integer value between 1 (for SFD) and 12 (for Dinf) and the boundary conditions (`bc`: 'flat', 'fixed' or 'slope')\n",

    "\n",
    "+ `sea`: the sea-level declaration with the relative sea-level `position` (m) and the sea-level `curve` which is a file containing 2 columns (time and sea-level position).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `climatic` & `tectonic` have the same structure with a sequence of events defined by a starting time (`start`) and either a constant value (`uniform`) or a `map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the parameters for the surface processes to simulate:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `sp_br`: for the _stream power law_ with a unique parameter `Kbr` representing the The erodibility coefficient which is scale-dependent and its value depend on lithology and mean precipitation rate, channel width, flood frequency, channel hydraulics. It is worth noting that the coefficient _m_ and _n_ are fixed in this version and take the value 0.5 & 1 respectively. In this example we consider that all eroded sediments  are transported as fine suspension `Ff`=1 and as such will never be redeposited.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `diffusion`: hillslope, stream and marine diffusion coefficients. `hillslopeK` sets the _simple creep_ transport law which states that transport rate depends linearly on topographic gradient. The marine sediment are transported based on a diffusion coefficient `sedimentK`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will need to specify the output folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `output`: with `dir` the directory name and the option `makedir` that gives the possible to delete any existing output folder with the same name (if set to False) or to create a new folder with the give `dir` name plus a number at the end (e.g. outputDir_1 if set to True)"
